# GTFS Modifier

A simple Python-based tool for making changes to GTFS files. For more information on GTFS, please see the reference documentation at https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/.

## Basic usage

Create a new GTFSModifier class that points to the directory where the tables are stored.
